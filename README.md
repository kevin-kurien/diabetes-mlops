# Diabetes Prediction Model – FastAPI + Docker + Kubernetes

This project is a Machine Learning application that predicts whether a person is diabetic based on health metrics such as pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, BMI, and age. The project demonstrates a full MLOps workflow, including training a model, creating a FastAPI API, Dockerizing the application, and deploying it to Kubernetes using kind.
